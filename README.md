# Algorithmic Game Solvers

This repository contains links to the algorithmic game solver repositories I have worked on, which implement apps that use techniques and algorithms like mathematically proven solutions, minimax with alpha-beta pruning, Monte Carlo tree simulations, and neural networks to accomplish a strong performance on games such as Rock-Paper Scissors, Blackjack, Othello (Reversi), and more:

## Mathematically Proven Solvers

These solvers use specialized, mathematically proven formulas to guarantee success in any situation to which a solution can be found:

- [Chomp](https://github.com/Shak2000/ChompSolver)
- [Nim](https://github.com/Shak2000/NimSolver)
- [N-Queens](https://github.com/Shak2000/N_Queens)
- [Sudoku](https://github.com/Shak2000/SudokuSolver)
- [Tower of Hanoi](https://github.com/Shak2000/TowerOfHanoiSolver)
- [Wordle](https://github.com/Shak2000/WordleSolver)

## Minimax Agents with Alpha-Beta Pruning

These solvers use the minimax algorithm to determine the best move at each step of the game, with the solution having a mathematical guarantee of correctness for some games like 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe. Alpha-beta pruning is used to ensure the efficiency of this algorithm:

- [3D Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/Shak2000/ThreeDTicTacToeSolver)
- [3 Men's Morris](https://github.com/Shak2000/ThreeMensMorrisSolver)
- [6 Men's Morris](https://github.com/Shak2000/SixMensMorrisSolver)
- [9 Men's Morris/Mills](https://github.com/Shak2000/MillsGameSolver)
- [Colonel Blotto](https://github.com/Shak2000/ColonelBlottoSolver)
- [Connect Four](https://github.com/Shak2000/ConnectFourSolver)
- [Dots and Boxes](https://github.com/Shak2000/DotsAndBoxesSolver)
- [Othello](https://github.com/Shak2000/OthelloSolver)
- [Oware](https://github.com/Shak2000/OwareSolver)
- [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/Shak2000/TicTacToeSolver)

## Monte Carlo Tree Simulators

These solvers use a Monte Carlo tree simulation to make an educated guess after sampling dozens of observations:

- [2048](https://github.com/Shak2000/TwentyFortyEight)
- [Blackjack](https://github.com/Shak2000/BlackjackSolver)
- [Checkers](https://github.com/Shak2000/CheckersSolver)
- [FreeCell](https://github.com/Shak2000/FreeCellSolver)

## Neural Networks

This solver has the user train a neural network to learn how to play the game:

- [Rock-Paper-Scissors](https://github.com/Shak2000/RockPaperScissorsAI)
